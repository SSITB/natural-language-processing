## Definition

The alphabet of human thought "is a concept originally proposed by Gottfried Leibniz that provides a universal way to represent and analyze ideas and relationships by breaking down their component pieces. All ideas are compounded from a very small number of simple ideas which can be represented by a unique character" (definition from [Ref.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_of_human_thought)).

Leibniz project included:

> - The identification of a system of primitives, organized in an alphabet of thought or in a general encyclopedia;
> - The elaboration of an ideal grammar, inspired probably by the simplifications proposed by Dalgarno, of which the simplified Latin is one example;
> The formulation of a series of rules governing the possible pronunciation of the characters;
> The elaboration of a lexicon of real characters upon which the speaker might perform calculations that would automatically lead to the formulation of true propositions.

## Personal Motivation

I am fascinated by the idea of systematizing and analyzing massive stores of human knowledge to build a hierarchical classification. My interest in the topic is far from recent and started when I first came into contact with Aristotle's [Porphyrian tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyrian_tree) and Leibniz's writings on knowledge systematization and formalization (his *characteristica universalis*). I am fascinated by his idea of constructing an overarching architecture to make human knowledge computational. 

This is an utterly overwhelming project so I decided to start from the basic of natural language processing methods. I will start covering:
- [Sentence Structure](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marcotav/natural-language-processing/blob/master/alphabet-human-thought/notebooks/sentence-structure/sentence-structure.ipynb)
- Grammars
- Meaning of Sentences

The rest of the steps will be defined as I move on.
