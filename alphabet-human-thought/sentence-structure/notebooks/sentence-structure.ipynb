    "- Understand how to use a formal grammar to describe the structure of sentences\n",
    "- Use syntax trees to represent the structure of sentences\n",
    "- Understand how parser analyze sentences and build a syntax tree\n",
    "\n",

    "Ths framework will be of generative grammar. From Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Generative grammar is a linguistic theory that regards grammar as a system of rules that generates exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "> A language is the collection of all grammatical sentences and a grammar is a formal notation that can be used to generate the members of this set.\n",

    "\n",
    "Following [book](https://www.nltk.org/book/) I will use the following quote my G. Marx to illustrate ambiguities found in language:\n",

    "\n",
    "To examine the ambiguous phrase sentence in bold we first define a grammar. About the syntax, `nltk.CFG.fromstring` returns the context-free grammar (CFG) corresponding to the input string. In the next section CFG will be discussed in detail but a quick definition is:\n",

    "> In formal language theory, a context-free grammar (CFG) is a certain type of formal grammar: a set of production rules that describe all possible strings in a given formal language. Production rules are simple replacements. "
